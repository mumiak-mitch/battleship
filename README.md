# Battleship

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your Battleship program files are located. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install readline-sync
   ```

   This command installs the `readline-sync` package, which is used for getting user input in the console.

3. **Run the Program:**
   Once the packages are installed, you can run your Battleship program. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

   This command executes the `main.js` file, which contains your Battleship game logic.

4. **Play the Game:**
   Follow the instructions in the console to place your ships and take turns attacking the computer's board. Input your moves as specified (e.g., A1 for coordinates). The game loop will continue until one player's ships are all sunk.
